            <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Activity</h2>
            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>My culture has influenced me both in terms of who I am but also who I am not. 
                In terms of my identity, from a young age never really connected with the idea of New Zealand culture and always felt inspiration and association more-so while consuming media from countries far abroad. 
                This was furthered ramified by my mum and step-dad who were vocal about wanting to leave New Zealand for a bigger and "better" country elsewhere. 
                Spending unquantifiable amounts of time on the internet as a pre-teen, I further develop an identity based around alternative American, European and Japanese cultural exports and would partake in seeking out emerging media, fashion and design from a range of blogging networks. 
                Although I still carry these influences with me and continue to seek out emerging cultural exports from around the world, I now see how my values around racial issue, idea of self and empathy are more closely linked to my upbringing In New Zealand.
            </p>
            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>
            <p>Looking back at the scope of my time spent studying or lack thereof, I can say that not holding any form of tertiary classification has made seeking employment very challenging. 
                Having left high school seven years ago, I have spent the majority of this time jumping between various entry-level jobs. 
                Without holding any current tertiary classification, I am left with all but a few employment options. 
                While hopping between workplaces and the lack of expectation from these roles has been great for funding personal creative projects and travel, now that I am approaching my mid-twenties, I feel it is the right time to pursue new avenues of employment. 
                Although working in these low-paying and high-stress jobs has been challenging. 
                The degree of understanding that comes from interacting with people from different backgrounds, has strengthened my ability to acknowledge other peoples circumstances.</p>
            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>    
            <p>One core strength for me while approaching this learning journey is my ability to break challenges and create a smaller set of manageable tasks. 
                Coincidentally this is one of the skills outlined by EDA and it felt good to see something I had been doing for sometime outlined as the ‘right’ way to approach tasks and challenges.
                Another strength I possess is the ability to solve problems, as a problem solver, I can think from a multitude of angles when approaching new tasks. 
                Having found some difficulties while undertaking this first sprint, I was able to reevaluate my approach and fathom different approaches to rectify the problem.</p>
            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            <p>An example of tension I experienced while approaching a team-based activity would be conflicts that arose while playing club football as a child. 
                On various occasions, my team-mates would miss the chance to score, because they took it upon themselves to shoot and not pass to an available teammate. 
                These situations would cause tension between my teammates and further affect our ability to play well. 
                To prevent this from happening again, I approached my teammates and coaches to discuss the said problem and see what we could do to rectify it. 
                In discussing this problem, my coaches were able to focus our practice on better team communication. 
                Looking back at this situation, I feel like what I did was the best way to approach the challenge and its ensuing tension. 
                Because this problem came down to team communication, the best way to treat was through additional team communication.</p>
