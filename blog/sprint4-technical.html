          Tell Us About A Time You Got Felt Blocked When Approaching a Simple Problem.
      </h2>
        <ul> 
          <h3>
                What was the problem?
          </h3>
          <li>
              I felt blocked when approaching the superfizzbuzz kata. I had watched videos of people doing these previously but with the little twist I wasn’t sure how to approach this. 
          </li>
          <h3>
                What problem-solving techniques did you use?  
          </h3>
          <li>
              I tried a combination of the learning techniques when approaching this block. I used pseudocode initially to help outline the steps I would have to take, I tried out what I had put down after that failing I used google. 
          </li>
          <h3>
              How did you feel throughout the process?
          </h3>
          <li>
              I felt pretty confused during this process. Pseudocode and googling are great when you have some idea of you are required to do ect. 
          </li>
          <h3>
              What did you learn?
          </h3>
          <li>
              I learnt that I should have reached out to some of my peers or facilitator for help. 
          </li>

        <h3>
              What Was The Problem You Solved In An Elegant Way?
        </h3>
        <li>
            I felt stuck while approaching one of the tasks in the manipulating javascript objects. 
        </li>
        <h3>
              What problem-solving techniques did you use?  
        </h3>
        <li>
            I used a combination of reading error messages and entering a few different lines of code that I thought would work. I eventually worked back from the pre-written test and managed to figure out exactly what I had to enter. 
        </li>
        <h3>
            How did you feel throughout the process?
        </h3>
        <li>
            I felt slightly confused at first but once I worked back from what I was already written I felt good about myself. 
        </li>
        <h3>
            What did you learn?
        </h3>
        <li>
            I learnt that it's good to look at code that has already been written out and use to your advantage. 
        </li>

      <h2>
        Reflect On How Confident You Feel Using The Problem Solving Techniques Outlined?
      </h2>
      <ul> 
        <h3>
            Pseudocode
        </h3>
        <li>
            I find this is a really great way to approach projects and should be implemented before any coding is done. I found this was only helpful though when I already had some knowledge of what I would code anyway. It is hard to outline something when you don’t know where to start.  
        </li>
        <h3>
            Trying Something 
        </h3>
        <li>
            This is a great method when you don’t know where to start. I found that just playing around with code helped me pass some of the tasks during the katas.  
        </li>
        <h3>
            Rubber Ducky Method
        </h3>
        <li>
            I have yet to implement this method but I can see it advantages. I think talking to someone about a problem can defiantly help you figure something out. I'm planning on getting some kind of cool figurine I could talk to when I get stuck.  
        </li>
        <h3>
            Reading Error Messages
        </h3>
        <li>
            This is obviously one of the first things you would do when testing your code. I found it helpful as a guide of what do do next when working through each task. Some of the syntax used can be a bit confusing so pays to have some knowledge of what you are doing beforehand. 
        </li>
        <h3>
            Console.logging
        </h3>
        <li>
              I didn’t utilise these during the kata’s but I think should start using this technique more so.  
        </li>
        <h3>
              Googling
        </h3>
        <li>
              This is defiantly one of the techniques I use the most when approaching a problem. 
        </li>
        <h3>
            Asking Your Peers For Help
        </h3>
        <li>
            I defiantly feel like I need to reach out more for help when I am stuck. I have noticed I have some insecurities around telling people I am failing/ struggling ect and I need to work on this. 
        </li>
        <h3>
            Asking Coaches For Help
        </h3>
        <li>
            Likewise to my previous answer. This is something I need to be mindful of and work towards using more so. 
        </li>
        <h3>
            Improving your process with reflection
        </h3>
        <li>
            I defiantly feel like my ability to reflect is strong and I use this to my advantage frequently. 
        </li>
