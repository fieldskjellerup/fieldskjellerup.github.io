        <h2>What Is a 'Display' Property?</h2>
        <p>
          To fully understand what a display property is, we must first understand how we style a webpage. 
          When creating a webpage, we use styling documents known as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which enable us to arrange and add colour to a website and its content. 
          Within these styling sheets, we utilise properties that specify exactly how this content will be arranged and coloured. 
          One such property we use regularly while creating our webpages styling is the ‘display’ property. 
          As the name states, the display property helps dictate exactly how this content will be displayed. 
          Taking this concept further, all properties within our styling document are followed by a value. 
          These property/ value pairs sit within a block of information, which links into our content sheet/ HTML document by the way of ‘selectors'. 
          Using a combination of selectors, properties and values, we can stylise our webpage in any way, shape or form imaginable! See the code and resulting output below for a visual representation of the concepts just discussed.</p>
          <h3>Example Of Selectors, Properties and Values</h3>
          <pre class="code-example"><code>&lt;h2&gt;This is a blue h2 element&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;style&gt;h2 {colour: blue;}&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre> 
          <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is a small portion of code we would likely see within our CSS document. 
            In this case, we have set the h2 element within our webpage to be stylised. 
            The property has been set to colour and will affect the colour of all h2 elements on our website. 
            The value has been set to a colour of blue.</em></p>
          <pre id="code-example-h2"><code>This is a blue h2 element</code></pre> 
          <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is the resulting input from the code we just looked at. 
            As desired, all h2 elements will now be displayed blue.</em></p>
    </section>

      <h2>What Does It Mean To Display Inline?</h2>
      <p>We will now focus on one-such property/ value paring known as ‘display inline’. 
        When display inline is declared within our styling sheet, the desired HTML element will be rendered explicitly as an inline-level element. 
        When we refer to an element as inline, we state that the element will only take up space around its content. 
        This is different to a block-level element which always takes up the full width of the webpage, regardless of if content. 
        Another main difference between the two, is that we can change the width and height of block-level elements, but not for inline. 
        With this in mind, some HTML elements are either set as inline or block by default.</p>
      <h3>Common elements in HTML that are inline-level by default</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;img&gt;</code></li>   
      </ul>
      <h3>Common elements in HTML that are block-level by default</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></li>   
      </ul>
      <p>Using CSS stylings we are also able to change these default settings. 
        See the code and resulting output below for a visual representation of the concepts just discussed.</p>
      <h3>Example of a inline element</h3>  
     <pre class="code-example"><code>&lt;p&gt;The following span is a &lt;span class=highlight>inline element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
     <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is a brief sentence which demonstrates how a span element will be displayed. 
       In this case, we have wrapped a span element around the words “inline element.”
       If the desired result is accomplished, a yellow highlight will be shown around the words “inline element.”</em></p>
       <pre id="code-example-inline"><code>The following span is a <span class=highlight>inline element</span></code></pre>
       <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is the resulting output of our code. 
         As expected the words “inline element” have been displayed with a yellow coloured highlight. 
         As the span is an inline element, only the content that fits between its opening and closing tags will be highlighted. </em></p>     
       <h3>Example of a block-level element</h3>  
     <pre class="code-example"><code>&lt;p&gt;The following paragraph is a &lt;p class=highlight>block-level element&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
     <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is a brief sentence which demonstrates how a paragraph (p) element will be displayed. 
       In this case, we have wrapped a paragraph element around the words “block-level element.” 
       If the desired result is accomplished, the words “block-level element” will be pushed away from the rest of the text and displayed on its own line. 
       The resulting output should also be highlighted a bright yellow colour and take up the whole width of the example.</em></p>
       <pre id="code-example-block-level"><code>The following paragraph is a <p class="highlight">block-level element</p></code></pre>
       <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is the resulting output of our code. As expected the words “block-level element” have been pushed away from the rest of the sentence and are now seated on their own line. 
        Our yellow highlight is also displayed across the whole width of the example.</em></p>     
       </section>
      <h2>What Does It Mean To Display Inline-Block?</h2>
      <p>Taking the concepts we have now learnt, let’s now look at the inline-block property/ value paring within CSS. 
        When the inline-block property/ value paring is declared, we will be able to specify the height and width of the element. 
        We will also be able to maintain the inline properties ability to sit next to other content and not create a new line as a block-level element would. 
        See the code and resulting output below for a visual representation of the concepts just discussed.</p>  
        <h3>Example of a the display inline-block property</h3>
        <pre class="code-example"><code>&lt;p&gt;The last two words in this sentence are styled with &lt;span class=inline-block&gt;display inline-block&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
        <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is a brief sentence which demonstrates how the display inline-block declaration will be displayed. 
          In this case, we have wrapped the inline-block property around the words “display inline-block.”
          If the desired output is achieved, we will have a small yellow box around the last three words in this text.</em></p>
         <pre id="code-example-inline-block"><code>The last two words in this sentence are styled with <span id="inline-block">display inline-block</span></code></pre>
       <p class=code-example-explanation><em>Shown above is the resulting output of our code. As expected the words “display inline-block” are now sitting inside a small yellow box.</em></p>
