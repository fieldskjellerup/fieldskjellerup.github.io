      <h2>Use An Analogy To Describe The Differences Between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML and CCS share a very close but strange relationship. HTML can live on its own independtly but CSS does not share this prividlge. CSS can not fuction independtly and must be aligned or "refereced" by the HTML document to be deemed useful. In this estranged relationship HTML is the ageing bore, a ridgid file which contains specfics and one-track minded appraoch to how it lives. On the other hand, CSS is the youthful creative and displays flair, character and views the world through muitple lenses when approaching a specific task. Although HTML can fully fuction on its own accord away from CCS, in todays modern and every evolving world, it is consedered best-practice or more socially acceptable that they retain a healhty and content codependency.</p>
