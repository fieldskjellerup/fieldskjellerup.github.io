                Foundations Core Skills
		</h2>
		<h3>
				Reflection
		</h3>
		<h4>
                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
		</h4>
		<p>
                From foundations I have learnt that I have a real lack of confidence when approaching task I find difficult, I tend to just through the towel in early and pushing myself can be a real challenge. I learnt that I can compare my strengths to others as a way to boost my confidence. I learnt that I have a very self-critical voice at times and learning to mitigate can be challenging. 
		</p>
		<h4>
                What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
		</h4>
		<p>
                Empathy and self-awareness is important in programming because in a working environment we need to be aware of the people around us. It is critical that we work well with our peers and having the ability to understand others will greatly affect how we conduct and complete our work.        
		</p>
		<h4>
                What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
		</h4>
		<p>
                What surprised me the most about learning core is how our abilities are not fixed and we are capable of learning new things at any age. I found <em><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve/discussion?languagenl"> Carol Dweck's TED talk</a></em> very insightful and understanding the growth mindset has already helped me during foundations. I find this to be invaluable and defiantly will help me navigate new learning material. I find that growing up with dyslexia has a big effect on my confidence when approaching challenges and learning new things. Going through foundations has highlighted these insecurities and the biggest challenge over this period has been confronting them. I like the idea that when you are trying to learn something new and you find it challenging, you are not dumb, but you are getting smarter! 
		</p>
		<h4>
                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
		</h4>
		<p>
                As mentioned above the most challenging part has been confronting my insecurities around my learning abilities. It has been a while since I was in any form of education, so I having this challenge come up for me has been insightful and important. 
		</p>
		<h4>
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
		</h4>
		<p>
                Being aware of our core skills enables us to work better with others and further our understanding of self. In a high-stress environment, we must be looking after both ourselves and the people that are around us. In Tech it is common for employees to look for people who will enhance the work environment through their emotional intelligence. 
		</p>
		<h4>
                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
		</h4>
		<p>
			    No, I don’t feel this is a waste of time. I feel like this is a very important thing to be aware of and implement into your life, regardless of being in Tech or not.

                Preparing for Bootcamp
        </h2>
        <h3>
                Reflection
        </h3>
        <h4>
                What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h4>
        <p>
                My long-term goal is to find a full-time job or freelance full-time work within web development/ Design and UI/UX. I will feel good about what I do and be appreciated by the people I am working with. I will have a good pay-rate. I will still have a lot of free time to work on my own projects and maintain freedom within my personal life. I would also like to find work that challenges me in a way that best suits my abilities and will create amazing and engaging work. 
        </p>
        <h4>
                What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h4>
        <p>
                I think the hardest thing for me will be working to such a tight schedule over nine weeks and knowing that if I miss one day I will fall behind. My biggest strength will be my ability to work with others.      
        </p>
        <h4>
                What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h4>
        <p>
                The biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be pushing myself through times of difficulty. I will have to remind myself that it is just part of the learning process and that this is a critical stage of my learning journey. 
        </p>
        <h4>
                What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
        </h4>
        <p>
                I would like to see my ability to ask for help grow and to be vulnerable enough to let people know that I am struggling. I think this is a key skill to use when going through Bootcamp and my time there will be greatly affected by this. 
        </p>
        <h4>
                What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
        </h4>
        <p>
                I expect myself to get to Bootcamp every morning at 8:30 and be a state of mind best suited for learning. I reach out for help when needed and not be afraid to let people know what I might be struggling on. I would like to complete Bootcamp feeling good about what I have accomplished!
