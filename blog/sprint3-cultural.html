            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the awareness of one's emotions and the emotions of others. 
                When practising emotional intelligence, we can separate ourselves from our current emotional stream and recognise how our emotions are affecting or can affect our thoughts and behaviours. 
                We are in turn, able to maintain a healthy relationship with our emotional responses and navigate life away from destructive impulses and habits. 
                Emotional intelligence also covers the understanding of others through non-verbal cues and in a broader sense, the ability to be empathetic.  
            </p>
            <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>IQ differs from EQ as it is the quantifiable measurement of ones ability to think logically, analytically and methodically. EQ is not measurable in this sense and is based on ones own lived emotions and how we navigate said emotions. 
            </p>
            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is important because when are aware of our emotions and our emotional responses, we are better equipped in dealing with the chaos and uncertainty that we face within our lives.</p>
