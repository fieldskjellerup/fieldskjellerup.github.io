            <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
            <h3>What Is Your Long Term Goal and or Career Pathway?</h3>
            <p>My long-term goal is to find a full-time job or freelance full-time work within web development/ web design. 
                I will feel good about what I do and be appreciated by the people I am working with. 
                I will have a good pay-rate. I will still have a lot of free time to work on my own projects and maintain freedom within my personal life. 
            </p>
            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>I will develop a more conscious approach to my time management while maintaining a good balance between my freedom and discipline with respect to studying and working at large.  
            </p>
            <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h3>
            <p>My core strengths revolve around understanding (respect, empathy, thoughtfulness) and creativity (problem-solving, abstract thinking, innovation)</p>
            <p>One thing that I find limiting in my life, is the brief periods of self-doubt and anxiety that I tend to go through regularly. This is turn affects my motivation, ability to focus and my ability to think critically.</p>
            <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
            <p>I will commit myself to better my ability to work within the allotted time-frames eg healthy daily routine. For me to do this, I need to find the motivation and inspiration I need to carry out a healthy daily routine.</p>
            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
            <p>I will seek help when needed firstly through online resources, secondly my peers and lastly my facilitators (depending on the context of the situation.)</p>
            <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
            <p>I expect devs facilitators to help guide me and my peers through the learning process effectively.</p>
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
                For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. 
                Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h3>
