				Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset
		</h2>
		<h3>
				Research Neuroplasticity
		</h3>
		<h4>
				How does learning the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?
		</h4>
		<p>
			When we begin to understand the principles of neuroplasticity, we begin to understand that we are all capable of learning new skills or abilities “when we put our minds to it."
		</p>
		<h4>
				How might you engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?
		</h4>
		<p>Engaging with these principals within my own life means understanding that when I have difficulty while learning new skills at Devs’s, I am able to overcome these difficulties with repeated mind-full practice.</p>
		<h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
		<p>I can increase my neuroplasticity through repetitively practising something that I find difficult, putting things I find difficult into a context where I can understand its relationship to already learnt knowledge and acknowledging that I have the ability to harbour new skills and abilities throughout understanding neuroplasticity.</p>
		<h4>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h4>
		<p>I found this short video to be very informative. You can watch it <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpfYCZa87g">here</a></em></p>
		<h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
		<h4>What is growth mindset and why it is relevant?</h4>
		<p>Growth mindset is a theory and study by Carol Dweck, which states we either have a growth or fixed mindset when approaching our ability to learn. When we understand the growth mindset, we know that we can change and enhance our abilities at any point in our lives! This is contrary to a fixed mindset, which focused on the brain as static and rigid, where people are not able to learn new abilities past childhood.</p>
		<p>This is relevant because with this mindset, we are able to make the most of our time spent at Devs and the teachings we are presented with.</p>
		<h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>
		<p>It was interesting watching Carol Dweck’s TED talk again after watching it while going through the prep curriculum. I noticed that a lot of things she mentioned, had, in fact, come up for me while I have been going through foundations. The way in which she discusses how we form a particular mindset surrounding our abilities from a young age, really rung a bell with me and certain things I have been thinking about recently. Specifically having dyslexia and how this has affected me into my adulthood.</p>
		<h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
		<p>I will integrate the growth mindset into my learning journey, by understanding that when I find something difficult I am not “dumb” but in fact, I am getting smarter!</p>
		<h4>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h4>
		<p>Carol Dweck's TED talk is pretty amazing and I would highly recommend watching it! You can check it out <em><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en">here</a></em></p>
